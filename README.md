# Brain Strike

Developed for the campfire festival in Dortmund, Brain Strike is a BCI game of risk for two players.

It uses a bluetooth enabled Mattel Mindflex and some python code to compare each player's level of concentration to fight over a certain region of the world.

The Concentration and Meditation algorithms are specific to the Mindflex and while the are more abstract than straight Alpha and Beta waves, they provide a more immediate response to how the player percieves his state.

This is a archived project that is meant for reference.  The original code is in a private repository on bitbucket.
